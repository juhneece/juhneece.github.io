Chances are my name poses a challenge for you, so to start us off on the right foot, here's a hint: *juh-neece buh-kweh-tiss*

I grew up in San Diego. You can easily identify me as a West coast transplant by my calm demeanor.  My two older sisters are still in California with my adorable nephew & niece, Ethan & Zoë. On the other side of the globe, my parents have happily retired in the Philippines.

I studied Business Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Since graduating, new opportunities and adventures have taken me from San Diego, to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and – most recently – New York, where I now live with my boyfriend [Ben](http://clarkbk.com). We have an apartment on the Brooklyn side of the East River, in Williamsburg, where we can thankfully retreat from the daily hustle.

## Work

Since March 2012, I've led the customer experience team at [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/) as the Director of Customer Insights. Prior to this, I worked at a few other startups:

* [Buddy Media](http://www.exacttarget.com/products/social-media-marketing/buddy-media) (acquired by Salesforce.com), Account Executive
* [Clover](https://www.clover.com/), Director of Sales
* [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/nyc), Sales Manager

You won't find the following jobs on my résumé or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbacuetes
) page, but I did my fair share of dabbling before entering the "real world". I've also worked as:

* A bank teller
* A server in a retirement home
* A receptionist in a martial arts studio
* An office assistant at a garage door installation company
* A flower delivery girl
* A librarian's assistant (a.k.a. a putter-back of books)

## Hobbies

When I'm not exploring the outdoors on a hike, hitting the pavement with my trusty road bike, or trying out a new restaurant, I love to get crafty. Check out some of the cards I've made for [the Winter holidays](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipNh68-UT_PjEO8PAodeH7g_PKWGSBZsDS1ckrYi) and [Valentine's Day](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipO4jn7SCzXtLP8_HFx1EVKuEnTtaX0ubm2Klpnc)!
