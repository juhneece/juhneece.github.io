Chances are my name poses a challenge for you, so to start us off on the right foot, here's a hint: *juh-neece buh-kweh-tiss*

I grew up in San Diego. You can easily identify me as a West coast transplant by my calm demeanor.  My two older sisters are still in California with my adorable nephew & niece, Ethan & Zoë. On the other side of the globe, my parents have happily retired in the Philippines.

In May 2017 on Memorial Day weekend, I married [Ben Clark](https://clarkbk.com/) in Brooklyn, NY. After 7 years of dating, our wedding was the first time our families met and one of the happiest days of my life.

Ben and I love to take one big trip a year. We've traveled to the Philippines, Istanbul, Maldives, Patagonia, Tanzania, and Rwanda.

## Work

I've worked at startups like [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/nyc), [Clover](https://www.clover.com/), [Buddy Media](http://www.exacttarget.com/products/social-media-marketing/buddy-media), [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/), and [Managed by Q](https://www.managedbyq.com/). I'm currently on the lookout for my next great adventure.


## Fun facts

* Nicknames: Neece, J-Nice, JB
* A sucker for surprises, I was once serenaded by a [pink gorilla](http://files.juhneece.com/vday2013.jpg) on Valentine's Day
* I don't cuss, but will often say things like "dagnabbit" (not as a joke)
* My sisters & I are all named after locally-famous Filipino actresses
* My handwriting is so small and neat that people almost always mistake it for computer type
* I always have time to watch *Shawshank Redemption*
* Past Halloween costumes: <span id="halloween_costume" style="display:none">Michael Jackson</span>

You won't find the following jobs on my résumé or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbacuetes
), but I did my fair share of dabbling before entering the "real world." I've also worked as:

* A bank teller
* A server in a retirement home
* A receptionist in a martial arts studio
* An office assistant at a garage door installation company
* A flower delivery girl
* A librarian's assistant (a.k.a. a putter-back of books)
