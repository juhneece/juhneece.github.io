Chances are my name poses a challenge for you, so to start us off on the right foot, here's a hint: *juh-neece buh-kweh-tiss*

I'm passionate about making things from scratch, whether on the job, [in the kitchen](https://goo.gl/photos/NZVf4hHpfbPq4iJF9), or [at the craft table](https://goo.gl/photos/M1Sj6kS3YoDMAKj68).

In the past, I've worked at startups like [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/nyc), [Clover](https://www.clover.com/), [Buddy Media](http://www.exacttarget.com/products/social-media-marketing/buddy-media), and [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/). In August 2015 I was thrilled to start my next chapter at [Managed by Q](https://www.managedbyq.com/) as Sr. Director of Account Management.

Between home and work, I'm always on the lookout for my next [adventure](https://youtu.be/84EH70dZpok?t=1m06s).

## Life

I grew up in San Diego. You can easily identify me as a West coast transplant by my calm demeanor.  My two older sisters are still in California with my adorable nephew & niece, [Ethan](http://files.juhneece.com/ethan.jpg) & [Zoë](https://youtu.be/cMV0Rx0A7-c). On the other side of the globe, my parents have happily retired in the Philippines.

I studied Business Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Since graduating, new opportunities and adventures have taken me from San Diego, to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and – most recently – New York.

## Fun facts

* Nicknames: Neece, J-Nice, JB
* A sucker for surprises, I was once serenaded by a [pink gorilla](http://files.juhneece.com/vday2013.jpg) on Valentine's Day
* I don't cuss, but will often say things like "dagnabbit" (not as a joke)
* My sisters & I are all named after locally-famous Filipino actresses
* My handwriting is so small and neat that people almost always mistake it for computer type
* I've made two strangers take off their headphones while riding the subway so that I could compliment them on their shoes
* I always have time to watch *Shawshank Redemption*
* Past Halloween costumes: <span id="halloween_costume" style="display:none">Michael Jackson</span>

## Work

You won't find the following jobs on my [résumé](http://files.juhneece.com/resume.pdf) or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbacuetes
), but I did my fair share of dabbling before entering the "real world." I've also worked as:

* A bank teller
* A server in a retirement home
* A receptionist in a martial arts studio
* An office assistant at a garage door installation company
* A flower delivery girl
* A librarian's assistant (a.k.a. a putter-back of books)
